## Home lighting re-imagined

Lumen provides a comprehensive solution for controlling digitally controlled light-bulbs, such as the Philips Hue.

## Perfect lighting, at just the right time

Lumen automatically adjusts color temperature and brightness to match natural daylight, creating indoor lighting that always feels comfortable and natural.

Lumen's schedule can be easily overridden with custom scenes, which are organized according to when you use them most.

Over time, Lumen learns your preferences and adjusts its schedule accordingly.

## Lumen won't leave you in the dark

At bedtime, Lumen only requires a single tap to turn off all of your lights.

Once you've set Lumen to sleep for the night, your phone's screen is dimmed, and the scenes you might need overnight are prioritized.

## Wake up with Lumen
When you wake up, a single tap tells Lumen to resume your lighting schedule.

You can also tell Lumen to wake you up at a specific time, slowly brightening your lights for a more gentle wake-up call than the one your old alarm clock provides.

## Never touch a light switch again

Based on your location, Lumen turns your lights on and off for you.

Using iBeacon, Lumen can also turn on and off lights in only rooms which are occupied. Lighting can be adjusted per-room, based on the unique preferences of each person in your hom
